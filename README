Terraform Cloud (TFC) is an application that manages Terraform runs in a consistent and reliable environment instead of on your local machine. 
It stores shared state and secret data, and connects to version control systems so that you and your team can work on infrastructure as code within your usual code workflow.

Creating workspaces in the UI can be tedious.  
The code in this repo is mean to automate that process by adding desired variables and integrating the workspace with the VCS repo of your choice.   

1. Clone this repo 
2. Copy the terraform.tfvars.sample file to terraform.tfvars
3. Insert the required variables as explained below.
4. terraform init ; terraform plan ; terraform apply
5. Go check your TFC account/organization to see your new workspace.

# This set of variables are used to create and configure the workspace we are creating.  

token                       = ""  <-- TFC API token  
organization                = ""  <-- TFC organization 
workspace_name              = ""  <-- Name of the workspace you want to create
vcs_repo                    = ""  <-- Format follows <organization>/<repository>
oauth_token_id              = ""  <-- Oauth token id from TFC organization VCS integration 

# The following variables will be created in the workspace we are creating.

tfe_vars_sensitive = {
    GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = ""
    foo = "bar"
}

env_vars_sensitive  = {
    Bob = "Alice"
}

tfe_vars_nonsensitive = {
    foo = "bar"
}

env_vars_nonsensitive  = {
    Bob = "Alice"
}
